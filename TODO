Feature-completeness:
* Write tpm_unbind()
 * Cap-add should call it
* Authorised-migration procotol
* Write README
* Audit licenses

Feature-expansion:
* Issuer-key-based secure channel establishment (eg. PAKE)
 * Using TPM randomness!
* Refine ticket generation protocol
 * Nonces may come from the wrong place and/or sources of randomness need
   to be indicated in ticket.
